          About Me
        </h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-left" className="text-align: justify;">
          I am a Software Developer with a solid foundation in full-stack web
          development. I graduated from the Full-Stack Web Developer program at
          the National University of Technology, Buenos Aires (UTN-BA), and I’m
          currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Software Development at the Higher
          Polytechnic Institute of Córdoba (ISPC), where I am a sophomore in my
          third semester. Additionally, I hold an Associate’s Programmer degree,
          specializing in Python, from the ISPC. <br /> My diverse background
          includes a high school diploma in Arts, Communications, and Design,
          and I previously pursued a master in Modern Literature. These
          experiences have enriched my creative problem-solving skills, which I
          now apply in the IT and programming world. My passion for technology
          began early: I completed my first Junior PC Operator course at age 12,
          even without owning a computer at the time. <br /> I am a
          self-motivated and empathetic individual who thrives in collaborative
          environments. I enjoy learning from others, sharing knowledge, and
          tackling challenges head-on. My journey reflects my deep enthusiasm
          for the IT field and my pride in evolving into a dedicated Developer.
          <br />I look forward to potential collaborations or working with you
          in the future.
