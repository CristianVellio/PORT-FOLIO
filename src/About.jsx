          About Me
        </h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-left" className="text-align: justify;">
          I’m a Full-Stack Software Developer, currently a student in the
          Bachelor’s in Technology of Software Development program at the Higher
          Polytechnic Institute of Córdoba (ISPC). Additionally, I am enrolled
          in the Full-Stack Web Developer higher education program at the
          National University of Technology, Buenos Aires Branch (UTN-BA), and a
          graduate of the Python Developer professional course at Codo a Codo,
          provided by the Buenos Aires City Government, Agencia de Aprendizaje.
          <br></br>
          My background includes a high school diploma in Arts, Communications,
          and Design. I also attended the bachelor’s program in Modern
          Literature, which provided me with valuable tools that I can apply in
          the IT and programming world. I completed my first course as a Junior
          PC Operator at the age of 12, despite not owning a PC at home. I have
          always been passionate about the IT universe, which is why I am both
          enthusiastic and proud to have made the career leap to become a
          full-fledged Developer.<br></br> I am a self-driven, empathetic,
          self-taught, and social individual who excels at working with others,
          learning from them, and sharing my knowledge. I hope we can
          collaborate or work together in the future.
